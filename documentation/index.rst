TheImageWhisperer is a `steganography <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography>`_ detection app.

In short, steganography is a the practice of hiding a secret message inside a photo,
such that the photo does not seem manipulated.

TheImageWhisperer detects such malicious photos!

This project was conceived and implemented at the `DataHack2018 <https://www.datahack.org.il/>`_ hackathon,
and its source code is available `here <https://github.com/llmaayanll/TheImageWhisperer>`_.
